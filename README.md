# NLP: Click Bait Classification

The Clickbait Classification Project is designed to compare the effectiveness of several machine learning algorithms in distinguishing clickbait from non-clickbait headlines. The objective is to identify which algorithm performs best at accurately classifying headlines, thereby providing a robust solution for filtering out clickbait content. Throughout the project, various models are trained, evaluated, and compared to determine the most efficient and accurate approach to clickbait detection
## Technology Stack

Technologies and libraries used:

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **TensorFlow**: Machine learning and neural networks library.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models implementation.
- **NLTK**: Natural language processing tasks.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized for this project is a comprehensive collection of news headlines from a variety of sources, both clickbait and non-clickbait, enabling the training of a balanced classification model. Key features of the dataset include:

**Headlines:** A compilation of headlines from multiple news outlets.

**Labels:** Binary classification where 1 signifies clickbait and 0 signifies non-clickbait.

**Volume:** A total of 32,000 entries split evenly between clickbait and non-clickbait categories.
